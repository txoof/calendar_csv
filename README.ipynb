    "# Google Calendar CSV Generator\n",
    "Python script for generating files suitable for import into Google Calendar based on `.csv` schedule files for N-day rotating block schedules. This script will produce one CSV for each unique event as well as a CSV for each day in the block rotation. These CSV files are fully compatible with Google Calendar and can be [imported by teachers into their calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). \n",
    "\n",
    "See a sample output CSV that is ready to be imported into Google Calendar [here](./hs_bell_schedule_sample.tgz).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your schedule has \"Block A, Block B, Block C, Lunch, Break 1, Break 2\" seven CSV files will be produced (one for each block, lunch, break and one for all of the days in the rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns\n",
    "Our school uses an 6-Day (Elementary School) and 8-Day (Middle/High School) rotation schedule with an alternate, shortened time-table that is used on a Wednesdays. Our instructional days are Monday-Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation schedule begins with a \"Day 1\" on the first day of school and continues N school-days before starting again. On Wednesdays we have an early dismissal that uses an \"alternate\" time-table with shorter blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7 | Day 8 | Day 1 |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "| Weds: 21/08/17 | Thurs: 21/08/18 | Fri: 21/08/19 | Mon: 21/08/23 | Tues: 21/08/24 | Weds: 21/08/25 | Thurs: 21/08/26 | Fri: 21/08/27 | Mon: 21/08/30 |\n",

    "\n",
    "Our highschool has 8 instructional blocks (A..H), two breaks, a \"Flex\" block and Lunch. This script produces 13 calendar CSV files. Teachers can then import just the blocks that are relevant to their work (e.g. [A, B, D, F, H, Break 2, Flex] ). The Rotation_Day.csv includes \"all day\" events that indicate the rotation day as well as the N/Total school day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use\n",
    "You will need the following:\n",
    "* Schedule file in `.csv` format \n",
    "    - [Sample](./hs_sample.csv)\n",
    "* Non-instructional days -- any day that the rotation should \"skip\" such as holidays, parent-teacher conferences, Professional Development days, etc. Weekend days (Saturday & Sunday) are automatically skipped. *Apologies to those that observe the Thursday/Friday weekend*\n",
    "    - Flat file with one day per line in YYYY/MM/DD format\n",
    "    - [Sample](./non_instruction_sample.txt)\n",
    "* Start & End Date \n",
    "    - YYYY/MM/DD format\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Quick Start Example\n",
    "Create a set of CSV files for the school year starting on 08 August 2021 and running until 17 June 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "`./gcal_csv_generator.py --start \"2021/08/18\" --end \"2022/06/17\" --non_instruction ./non_instruction_days.txt --schedule_file HS_2021-22_bell_schedule.csv --output ~/Desktop/HS_21-22_CSV`    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a CSV file\n",
    "To create a CSV file, use the sample [CSV template](./sample.csv) provided using your favorite spreadsheet program. Make sure the CSV file created uses commas as separators and is saved as a plain text CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [HS Sample](./hs_sample.csv) for a 8-Block rotation over 8 days with an alternate shortened schedule. The [ES Sample](./es_sample.csv) shows a 6 day rotation with no alternate wednesday schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Columns:**\n",
    "* **`day`** Unique title of day in rotation (e.g. Day 1, Blue, Alpha, etc.)\n",
    "* **`subject`** Title of subject/block name (e.g. Block A, 3A Music, Lunch, etc.)\n",
    "    - All subjects with the same \"title\" will be grouped together in final CSV\n",
    "* **`start`** Start time in HH:MM format (e.g. 13:55, 08:30)\n",
    "* **`end`** End time in HH:MM format (e.g. 08:45, 15:35)\n",
    "* **`alternate`** this is an \"alternate\" schedule as boolean: (True/False/\\<blank\\>)\n",
    "* All other columns will be ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
